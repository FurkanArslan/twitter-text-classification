# twitter-text-classification

**A sentiment analysis tool for English tweets**

There is a file named **twitter_sentiment_corpus.cvs**. This file has been used to train a model to classify a tweet into one of the following three sentiment categories: 
* **positive**
* **negative**
* **neutral**

This program should test the model using 10-fold cross validation. 

This means that I have randomly chosen 90% of the data as training set and 10% of the data as test set. Then, using the training set, the program learns the parameters of the model and using the test set, you should test the model. This should be repeated 10 times.
